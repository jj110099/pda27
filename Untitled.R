#We can see that the p-values for youtube and facebook is extremely small, which means that we reject the null hypothesis that YouTube and Facebook do not impact sales. On the other hand, the p-value for newspaper is greater than 0.05, which means itâ€™s not a significant value. We fail to reject the null hypothesis that there is any significant relationship between newspaper ads and sales. I will create a second model to exclude the variable newspaper.
